#!/bin/bash

# Script for connecting to different HTB VPNs
# the current version of the script assumes that you store your VPN config files in $HOME/vpn
# it also assumes that you have not renamed your ovpn config files

# Future version will create the missing dir and check for any ovpn files to be moved to the vpn folder

# this was a quick 10min script that I hope others on the HTB community or any others might find useful when dealing with multiple VPNs
